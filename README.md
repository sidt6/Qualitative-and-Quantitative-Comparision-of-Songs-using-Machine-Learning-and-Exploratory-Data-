# Qualitative-and-Quantitative-Comparision-of-Songs-using-Machine-Learning-and-Exploratory-Data-
The project involves a qualitative and quantitative comparison of songs using machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Qualitative comparison involves analyzing musical features, such as genre, tempo, and mood, to identify similarities and differences between songs. Quantitative comparison entails using machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful patterns and relationships from song data, enabling clustering, classification, or recommendation tasks. EDA techniques further enhance the understanding of the data, revealing insights into musical trends and preferences. The project combines both approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of songs, aiding in music recommendation systems and music-related research.
